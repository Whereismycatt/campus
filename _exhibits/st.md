contents: St Thomas' campus is located on the south bank of the Thames in the London Borough of Lambeth, directly across from Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. The campus houses the Departments of Further Education and Dentistry, as well as the famous Nightingale Memorial and St Thomas' Hospital. It's worth noting that St. Thomas' is King's College London's newest campus, having been renovated just five years ago to add space for health education and training.
