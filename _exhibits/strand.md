contents: The <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/visit/strand-campus">Strand Campus</a>, located on the north bank of the Thames, is the oldest and largest in scope at Kingâ€™s College London. It is conveniently located in the City of Westminster, the heart of London. Its original campus consisted of the King's Building, which was designed and built in 1831, but as King's College London grew, the campus expanded to include the Chesham Buildings, the Strand Building, and the East Wing of Somerset House, among other buildings<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strand_Campus">[1]</a>. Bush House and the King's Building are the main parts of the Strand Campus. Bush House is used to be the Headquarters of the BBC World Service <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_House">[2]</a>. The King's Building consists of King's Building Foyer, Great Hall, College Chapel and Anatomy Theatre and Museum<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Building,_London">[3]</a>.The campus is dominated by humanities, law, and social sciences faculty, but it also houses the Faculty of Natural and Mathematical Sciences. The Strand Campus is near the <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/visit/maughan-library">Maughan Library</a>, which is the KCL's main library and the largest new university library in the UK since the Second World War <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maughan_Library#cite_note-times-5">[2]</a>. Notably, the Strand campus is next to <a href="https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/about-somerset-house">Somerset House</a>, a famous working arts centre in central London. KCL students can go here to see curations or experience ice skating activities. This campus is also near the Covent Garden business district, which is only a 10-minute walk away from a variety of theatres, restaurants, pubs, cafes, market stalls, and friendly interaction with street artists. This allows students to take advantage of the city's excellent business and cultural opportunities.
