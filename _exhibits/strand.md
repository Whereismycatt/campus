contents: The Strand campus, located on the north bank of the Thames, is the oldest and largest in scope at Kingâ€™s College London. It is conveniently located in the City of Westminster, the heart of London. Its original campus consisted of the King's Building, which was designed and built in 1831, but as King's College London grew, the campus expanded to include the Chesham Buildings, the Strand Building, and the East Wing of Somerset House, among other buildings. The campus is dominated by humanities, law, and social sciences faculty, but it also houses the Faculty of Natural and Mathematical Sciences. Notably, the Strand campus is near the Covent Garden business district, which is only a 10-minute walk away from a variety of theatres, restaurants, pubs, cafes, market stalls, and friendly interaction with street artists. This allows students to take advantage of the city's excellent business and cultural opportunities.
