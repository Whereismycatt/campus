content: The Waterloo Campus is on the south bank of the River Thames, across from the Strand Campus. The Waterloo Bridge, a 10-minute walk away, connects the two campuses and provides views of the London Eye, Big Ben, and other famous sights along the way. In this area, the President's Office and the main administrative units are housed in the James Clerk Maxwell Building. The departments of Health, Life Sciences, Education, and a portion of Nursing are housed in the Franklin-Wilkins Building, the campus's largest structure.
