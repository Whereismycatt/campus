contents: <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/visit/denmark-hill-campus">Denmark Hill Campus</a> is located in the London Borough of Southwark, in Camberwell. <a href="https://www.kch.nhs.uk">King's College Hospital</a>, <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/visit/maudsley-hospital">Maudsley Hospital</a>, <a href="https://www.kch.nhs.uk/news/media/kings-on-tv/the-truth-about-your-teeth/kings-dental-institute">Dental Institute</a>, and the <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ioppn">Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience</a> are located on the campus. The Maudsley Hospital cooperates with the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience of KCL <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maudsley_Hospital">[1]</a>. The previous name of the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience is the Maudsley Hospital Medical School and the Institute of Psychiatry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Psychiatry,_Psychology_and_Neurosciences">[2]</a>. After joining the KCL, it changed its name to the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience. The Denmark Hill Campus is King's College London's only campus that is not on either side of the Thames and is relatively far south of the city centre. The relative distance from the city centre, on the other hand, provides students living here with more cost-effective accommodation options, allowing them to enjoy the surrounding bars, restaurants, gyms, and other recreational facilities at a lower cost than in the city centre.
