contents: <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/visit/denmark-hill-campus">"Denmark Hill Campus"</a> is located in the London Borough of Southwark, in Camberwell. King's College Hospital, Maudsley Hospital and the Dental Institute are located on the campus. This campus is King's College London's only campus that is not on either side of the Thames and is relatively far south of the city centre. The relative distance from the city centre, on the other hand, provides students living here with more cost-effective accommodation options, allowing them to enjoy the surrounding bars, restaurants, gyms, and other recreational facilities at a lower cost than in the city centre.
