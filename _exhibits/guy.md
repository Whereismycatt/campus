contents: This campus is located on the south bank of the Thames, near London Bridge, and is dominated by Guy's Hospital, which was founded in 1726 by Thomas Guy and includes academic units in dentistry, medicine, and biomedicine. The King's Gordon Museum of Pathology, which is also on Guy's campus, is the largest medical museum in the United Kingdom. It is worth noting that Borough Market, London's most famous food market, is located right next to Guy's campus and offers a wide variety of food from East Asia, Africa, Western Europe, and other regions, providing students attending Guy's campus with a diverse range of food options.
